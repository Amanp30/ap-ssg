## Installation

To get started with **AP-SSG**, you can easily install it using npm.

### Install for Project

To install the package for your project, run the following command:

```shell
npm install ap-ssg
```

### Install as Dev Dependency

If you only need it as a development dependency (e.g., for build scripts), use this command:

```shell
npm install ap-ssg --save-dev
```

## Next Step: Setup Configuration

Once installed, proceed to set up the [config file](./setup-config.md) to configure your project according to your
specific needs.
