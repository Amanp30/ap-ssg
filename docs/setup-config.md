## Setup `apssg.config.js` file

After completing the [installation](./installation.md), run the following command to automatically generate the config
file:

```shell
npx ap-ssg init
```

Alternatively, you can manually create the `apssg.config.js` file in the project root and define the configuration
object as shown below:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  "mode": "development",
  "websiteName": "Example Website",
  "websiteDescription": "Example website description",
  "productionURL": "https://example.com",
  "developmentURL": "http://localhost:63342/ap-ssg/build",
  "metaTitleTemplate": "%title - %siteName",
  "themeColor": "#3d0665",
  "websiteLang": "en-us",
  "organization": {},
  "integrations": {
    "googleAnalytics": "",
    "bingWebmasters": "",
    "googleWebmasters": "",
    "hotjarAnalytics": "",
    "googleTagManager": "",
    "facebookPixel": "",
    "microsoftClarity": ""
  },
  "pwa": {
    "enabled": true,
    "description": "Your pwa description",
    "short_name": "Example",
    "htmlFiles": [
      "index.html"
    ],
    "start_url": "/index.html",
    "display": "standalone",
    "background_color": "#ffffff",
    "theme_color": "#3d0665",
    "orientation": "portrait"
  }
};
```
